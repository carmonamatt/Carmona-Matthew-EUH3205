Rise to Power:

Napoleon was able to seize power mainly because the current government, The Directory, was widely unpopular and the French Revolution had upended traditional social order.  The Directory, a committee of five corrupt officials that was formed in 1795 after the fall of Robespierre, was unfavorable to the people.  In addition, the French Government was also bankrupt with high inflation rates, unemployment, and uneven taxation.  These major political and social turmoils put Napoleon in the strategic position to seize power.[^1]  Using his stellar military reputation and the people’s hatred of the Directory to gain power, Napoleon staged a coup d’etat in 1799 which replaced the Directory with a three-person Consulate leadership.  Napoleon placed himself in charge of the new government as First Consul.[^2]  On May 18th, 1804, using the censorship of the press and presenting himself as the leader that France needs, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French and thus abolished the Consulate.  Napoleon was now the sole and undisputed leader of France.

Social, Economic and Political Issues Before and During Napoleon’s Reign:

The period before Napoleon’s rise to power was riddled with social, economic, and political issues that played a factor in Napoleon’s rise to power and in his policies.  

First, before Napoleon’s reign, France was divided into three distinct social groups entitled the Three Estates.  The First Estate consisted of the clergy who were largely exempt from taxes, the Second Estate included the aristocracy who also enjoyed significant privileges and tax exemptions, and the Third included the vast majority of the population such as peasants, artisans, the working class, commoners, and the bourgeoisie.  Despite having very little political power, the Third Estate was responsible for most of the taxes.  This political and economic inequality created dissatisfaction and tension between the classes.  Even though the Estate system and feudalism were technically abolished by the National Constituent Assembly in 1789, social inequality and tension along estate lines continued well into Napoleon’s reign.[^3]  Much of Napoleon’s support came from the Third Estate- the military, the bourgeoisie and the workers- even though Napoleon did not largely change the unequal social climate or implement many of the radical policies that the Third Estate had hoped for.  Nevertheless, the Third Estate supported Napoleon for the ideals of a new social order, economic stability, nationalism, military success, and the formation of a meritocracy.[^4]  As we will see by his policies, Napoleon was only able to deliver on a few of these hopes. 

Second, France was suffering from a major financial crisis before Napoleon’s rise to power.  Under the Ancien Regime, a financial crisis was caused by the following: an ineffective tax system where the burden was placed on the Third Estate, state debt from the American War of Independence, failed attempts at financial reform by Turgot and Necker, and poor harvests in 1780 combined with high bread prices.[^5]  Under the Directory in 1797, the French Empire officially went bankrupt.  Inflation also skyrocketed when the anti-French coalition printed and circulated four-billion counterfeit bills.  This led to a food crisis, high rates of unemployment, extreme public dissatisfaction, and calls for reform.  Napoleon, however, was able to provide that reform and his policies greatly improved France’s financial situation.

Third, there was tight political control, censorship, and limited rights for women that existed before Napoleon gained power.  However, these social and political issues increased under Napoleon’s policies.  Before Napoleon’s rise to power, there was already limited political freedom for the commoners and bourgeoisie.  Instead of increasing this political power, Napoleon instead increased censorship of the press and controlled political opposition through plebiscites.  For example, in 1802, Napoleon held a plebiscite to elect himself Consul for Life.  In 1804, Napoleon held another plebiscite, this time to crown himself emperor. [^6]  By plebiscites and censorship of the press, Napoleon kept tight political control and did not increase these rights much for the Third Estate.[^7]  Women also had little autonomy and society was largely patriarchal.  Fathers and husbands were given power over their families, property, wives, and children.  Women were considered legally subordinate to their husbands, divorce was more restrictive for women, and up until 1965, women were not allowed to work without their husband’s permission.[^8]  While Napoleon was able to make some sweeping reforms in other aspects of French life, the political control, the censorship of the press, and the limited rights for women did not change much under Napoleon’s policies.
