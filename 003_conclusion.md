In conclusion, the Napoleonic era had long lasting consequences across a broad set of fields. Napoleon influenced every field of practice he touched and did so with the sole goal of increasing his own power, and maintaining it. Through these practices that Napoleon created and manipulated, Napoleon created a system of governance and warfare that would see the other powers of Europe attempt to match and adopt. These rulers would also be left adapting to the wake of his wars with them and the political and legal structures he left behind. Napoleon implemented changes throughout every level of government and revolutionized the way that Franceâ€™s legal code was structured and functioned through the Napoleonic Code. This code is still in use in France, though it has been amended, and its framework can be found in the legal systems across mainland Europe. He also changed the way that militaries functioned and even how they were formed in the first place through the use of levee en masse, a recent and unpopular policy that would become more widespread across Europe and even the globe throughout the 19th and even 20th century. Napoleon would also use Nationalism as a tool just like any other in order to gather and cement his power and further his goals. This tactic would gain new life in other states as nationalism began to take form and raise nationalism movements throughout the later half of the 19th century and into the 20th. His cult of personality would be emulated by future rulers in France and abroad. Every step of the way, Napoleon created institutions and modified practices that would last throughout the 19th century. The century after the Napoleonic Era would see the various rulers of Europe adopting the practices of Napoleon which had seen him climb so high.  With the titular man himself at the helm, The Napoleonic Era left its consequences and impacts across the landscape of Europe throughout the 19th century.
