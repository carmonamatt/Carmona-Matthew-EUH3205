# The French Social, Economic, and Political Climate Before and During Napoleon’s Reign and How It Influenced Napoleonic Policies 

Intro: 

When Napoleon was first able to seize power, France was in a period of political and economic instability.  As we will discuss in this section, the social, political, and economic atmosphere of the time influenced Napoleon’s policies.  He either demonstrated his conservative tendencies by maintaining much of the current social order, or he implemented sweeping reforms that helped elevate France’s position on the world stage.  Before discussing the social and economic issues before and during Napoleon’s reign and how they influenced his major policies, we will give a brief overview on how Napoleon came into power.  

Rise to Power: 

Napoleon was able to seize power mainly because the current government, The Directory, was widely unpopular and the French Revolution had upended traditional social order.  The Directory, a committee of five corrupt officials that was formed in 1795 after the fall of Robespierre, was unfavorable to the people.  In addition, the French Government was also bankrupt with high inflation rates, unemployment, and uneven taxation.  These major political and social turmoils put Napoleon in the strategic position to seize power.1  Using his stellar military reputation and the people’s hatred of the Directory to gain power, Napoleon staged a coup d’etat in 1799 which replaced the Directory with a three-person Consulate leadership.  Napoleon placed himself in charge of the new government as First Consul.2  On May 18th, 1804, using the censorship of the press and presenting himself as the leader that France needs, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French and thus abolished the Consulate.  Napoleon was now the sole and undisputed leader of France.  

Social, Economic and Political Issues Before and During Napoleon’s Reign: 

The period before Napoleon’s rise to power was riddled with social, economic, and political issues that played a factor in Napoleon’s rise to power and in his policies.   

First, before Napoleon’s reign, France was divided into three distinct social groups entitled the Three Estates.  The First Estate consisted of the clergy who were largely exempt from taxes, the Second Estate included the aristocracy who also enjoyed significant privileges and tax exemptions, and the Third included the vast majority of the population such as peasants, artisans, the working class, commoners, and the bourgeoisie.  Despite having very little political power, the Third Estate was responsible for most of the taxes.  This political and economic inequality created dissatisfaction and tension between the classes.  Even though the Estate system and feudalism were technically abolished by the National Constituent Assembly in 1789, social inequality and tension along estate lines continued well into Napoleon’s reign.3  Much of Napoleon’s support came from the Third Estate- the military, the bourgeoisie and the workers- even though Napoleon did not largely change the unequal social climate or implement many of the radical policies that the Third Estate had hoped for.  Nevertheless, the Third Estate supported Napoleon for the ideals of a new social order, economic stability, nationalism, military success, and the formation of a meritocracy.4  As we will see by his policies, Napoleon was only able to deliver on a few of these hopes.   

Second, France was suffering from a major financial crisis before Napoleon’s rise to power.  Under the Ancien Regime, a financial crisis was caused by the following: an ineffective tax system where the burden was placed on the Third Estate, state debt from the American War of Independence, failed attempts at financial reform by Turgot and Necker, and poor harvests in 1780 combined with high bread prices.5  Under the Directory in 1797, the French Empire officially went bankrupt.  Inflation also skyrocketed when the anti-French coalition printed and circulated four-billion counterfeit bills.  This led to a food crisis, high rates of unemployment, extreme public dissatisfaction, and calls for reform.  Napoleon, however, was able to provide that reform and his policies greatly improved France’s financial situation. 

Third, there was tight political control, censorship, and limited rights for women that existed before Napoleon gained power.  However, these social and political issues increased under Napoleon’s policies.  Before Napoleon’s rise to power, there was already limited political freedom for the commoners and bourgeoisie.  Instead of increasing this political power, Napoleon instead increased censorship of the press and controlled political opposition through plebiscites.  For example, in 1802, Napoleon held a plebiscite to elect himself Consul for Life.  In 1804, Napoleon held another plebiscite, this time to crown himself emperor. 6  By plebiscites and censorship of the press, Napoleon kept tight political control and did not increase these rights much for the Third Estate.7  Women also had little autonomy and society was largely patriarchal.  Fathers and husbands were given power over their families, property, wives, and children.  Women were considered legally subordinate to their husbands, divorce was more restrictive for women, and up until 1965, women were not allowed to work without their husband’s permission.8  While Napoleon was able to make some sweeping reforms in other aspects of French life, the political control, the censorship of the press, and the limited rights for women did not change much under Napoleon’s policies.   

Napoleonic Policies: 

Now that we have covered some of the major social, economic, and political issues before and during Napoleon’s rise to power, we can discuss Napoleon’s policies and how they were affected by the French political and social climate.  

Napoleon’s first major policy was the creation and implementation of the Napoleonic Code.  Also known as the French Civil Code, the Napoleonic Code was a uniform set of laws implemented in 1804 that was designed to unify and update the outdated laws of the French Empire.9  The Civil Code codified several different branches of law and created separate categories for criminal, civil, and family law.  The Code was also widely spread throughout the French Empire and was implemented in Italy, Poland, Holland, Illyria, and many German states.10  Under this code, the laws were simplified, better organized, secular, and available to the common people.  Previously, the laws were arbitrarily decided and unfair since many commoners were unaware of the laws.  The laws were also closely tied to the Church.  Napoleon’s code publicized a set secular legal standard and by making the laws widespread throughout France and available to everyone, Napoleon was able to decrease the arbitrariness of French law.  The French Civil Code left the social order and the inequality largely unchanged, but the code did abolish feudalism, bondage, and guilt restrictions, and protect property rights.11  While the members of the previous Third Estate did not see much of an increase in their political rights, all male citizens were granted equal rights and the right to religious freedom/dissent under the Napoleonic Code, “every Frenchman shall enjoy civil rights”.12  The code, however, severely limited women’s rights.  The code established patriarchal authority and gave husbands ultimate authority over their wives, “a married woman has no domicile but that of her husband”, “the wife is obligated to live with her husband”, “the wife cannot plead in her own name, without the authority of her husband”.13  Despite maintaining some of the traditional social order, the Napoleonic code was nevertheless widely popular in France because it abolished feudalism, protected property rights, created equality before the law, created a meritocracy, simplified the legal system, made the laws known, and implemented stronger economic policies.14  

Napoleon’s second major policy was driven by France’s economic crisis.  In 1800, Napoleon created the Bank of France to stabilize France’s bankruptcy, inflation, unemployment, and debt.15  The Bank of France was a centralized chartered system that was backed by shareholders and the government itself.  As a centralized program, the Bank of France organized the payment system, managed the government account, and gave loans to finance crisis, resort services, wars, and extreme political events.16  The banking system also created a monopoly on banknotes and helped fund the treasury.17  Overall, the Bank’s main goal was to stabilize the payment system by monetizing debts and by backing paper money and banknotes with gold.  Banknotes and bank bills of exchange backed by gold or silver were effective and cost-efficient when compared to circulating coins.  Paper money backed by real wealth increased confidence in the financial systems, facilitated credit, and supported economic growth.  The Bank of France also successfully created a better system of tax collection, of funding wars and public debt, and of reducing short-term debt.18  Napoleon’s Bank of France played a huge role in decreasing inflation, helping to increase employment, centralizing the banking system, and in improving paper money, tax collection, industry, and commerce.  Napoleon created the Bank of France to help dissipate the financial crisis and to promote French business, and he successfully did just that.   

The third major Napoleonic policy that we chose to focus on was the reinstitution of colonial slavery for financial reasons.  In 1802, Napoleon decided to reimplement colonial slavery to help improve France’s precarious financial situation.  Previously, France was the first major power to abolish slavery in 1794 due to severe slave revolts in Saint-Domingue.19  However, the demand for sugar, coffee, trade opportunities, and the dream of an extensive colonial empire caused Napoleon to reverse the previous law and reinstitute colonial slavery.20  Specifically, slavery was reintroduced in Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe.  These colonies used the plantation system which relied heavily on slave labor and had the potential to be economically successful.  However, reimplementing slavery turned out to be a major miscalculation on Napoleon’s part.  From the previous uprisings in 1794, there were already strong resistance movements established in these colonies.  In Saint-Domingue, Toussaint Louverture led a massive uprising for independence and the abolition of slavery.  These uprisings along with the unpopularity of slavery with the French people, caused Napoleon to withdraw.21  Due to these resistance movements, France permanently lost Saint-Domingue and Napoleon’s dream of a global colonial empire was diminished.  All in all, the economic policy of reimplementing slavery was one of Napoleon’s mistakes, but it still demonstrates how the French political and economic climate motivated Napoleon’s policies.   

Napoleon had many other successful policies that were also motivated by the social, economic, and political climate of France.  For examples of more social policies, Napoleon created a meritocracy to award civil service, government, and military positions by merit instead of by birth.22  The meritocracy was incredibly popular with the bourgeoisie, the workers, and the forming middle class.  Napoleon also implemented several educational reforms and created a system of higher education.  He established lycées, or secondary schools, tightly controlled by the government to train young boys for future governmental and military service.  Napoleon also focused on central, standardized, and specialized education and he created the University of France.23  Lastly, in order to give the French people more freedom, to reduce social tensions, and to create a more secularized government, Napoleon made the Concordat of 1801 with the Pope.  This agreement recognized Catholicism as the main religion in France, but the state was made more secular and religious freedom was given to Protestants and Jews.24  Many of Napoleon’s other policies also demonstrate how he was influenced by the current social and political climate in France.  

As we have explored, several of Napoleon’s policies were motivated by the social demands of the bourgeoisie, the role of women, the Three Estates, and the legal climate.  Napoleon was also determined to fix France’s financial crisis; the creation of the Bank of France and the reinstitution of colonial slavery clearly demonstrate this goal.  Napoleon did successfully elevate France’s financial position, but he did not increase the rights of women, political freedom, or freedom of the press.  Napoleon worked to keep tight political control through plebiscites and censorship of the press.  Nonetheless, Napoleon was very popular among the bourgeoisie, the military, and the commoners.  Most of Napoleon’s policies are successful representations of France’s social, economic, and political climate before and during Napoleon’s rise to power.

Beyond influencing both international policy and militarism throughout the nineteenth-century, Napoleon advanced European thoughts of “national-selfhood.” Indeed, this is nowhere more apparent than in France during the post-Napoleonic era, particularly amidst the passage of restrictive international legislation by the Congress of Vienna. In fact, as Sudhir Hazareesingh states in his article “Memory, Legend and Politics: Napoleonic Patriotism in the Restoration Era,” the post-Napoleonic era was “a bedrock of ideas, beliefs, symbols and images which mythologized the Emperor and turned him into an object of popular cult;” Napoleon thus “became . . . a rallying point for all the men and women who refused to accept their nation’s containment by the 1815 treaties.”[^1] Thus, although conservative powers attempted to suppress the former French insurgence, this effort only heightened citizens’ incorporation of Napoleon into their public history as an element of cultural resistance. Arguably, the Restoration period encouraged a nostalgic, retrospective analysis of Napoleon’s reign on the part of French citizens. The Emperor himself persisted within the French state as an article of nationalist iconography; united by a shared experience, the French public venerated the legacy of Napoleon as a cultural, centripetal force.

Although this same nationalist-causational relationship cannot be superimposed on foreign territories conquered by Napoleon, the French Emperor nonetheless instilled notions of “political autonomy” and “nationhood” in said European peoples. In fact, this historical effect is entirely antithetical to the intentions of Napoleon’s regime, which did not envision a cultural indoctrination of new European subjects, as David A. Bell propounds. In his chapter “Revolutionary France and the Origins of Nationalism: An Old Problem Revisited,” Bell cites that “[o]ne became part of [France] by submitting to the Empire’s institutions and laws, and by giving complete and utter obedience to the Emperor.”[2] And yet, although Napoleon’s imperial conquest did not champion cultural inclusivity so much as civil homogenization, his invasions inspired a reactionary nationalism from the principalities/states who attempted to thwart his political control. Indeed, the former French emperor served as a hearth for nationalism principally through the reactionary movements that his conquests inspired, rather than the very success of his imperial ventures. For example, as Filippo Sabetti contends, “[t]he Napoleonic hegemony over the Italian Peninsula between 1796 and 1814 helped to foster the idea that some kind of Italian nation existed or ought to exist.” Thus, as mentioned in Sabetti’s article, external influences, such as that of Napoleon, encouraged ideas of a public “collective,” one that sought to resist imperial demarcations. The geographic and political effects of Napoleon’s reign extended to the mid-century “springtime of peoples,” with “[t]he revolts of 1848 beg[inning] with the Palermo uprising against Bourbon rule in January 1848.”[3] However, the presence of Napoleon’s influence in 1848 extended to other states as well, notably that of German Federation. After all, Napoleon’s initial invasion of German states in “[1806] brought humiliating military defeat and occupation for Prussia, the demise of the Holy Roman Empire, and a complete territorial and structural reorganization for the region,” as Katherine Aaslestad and Karen Hagemann conclude; the consequent result of such political turmoil—propagated by Napoleon—was a “German national ‘awakening’.”[4] Thus, similar to Italy, the introduction of foreign control spurred questions of national as well as political selfhood. Furthermore, Napoleon’s empire cultivated a brief power vacancy in the German lands, removing older systems of power; by upending the former political order, Napoleon provided German citizens with the opportunity to generate new concepts of government, and more importantly, derive these concepts from cultural stimuli.

Building on the public nationalist fervor witnessed during “the springtime of peoples,” European imperialist efforts utilized cultural identities and histories to support their international expeditions, at the end of the nineteenth-century. In his 1885 History Repeats Itself, Austrian-American Joseph Ferdinand Keppler embodies European fears of anti-imperialist sentiments. Depicting a figure akin to Julias Caesar in the far background and John Bull in the foreground, a destabilized Napoleon divides the two eras.[5] Although Keppler’s work cautions European international ventures, it nonetheless demonstrates the pervasive influence Napoleon’s previous conquests within Europe had on late-nineteenth century imperialism. After all, as Bell elucidates, “[t]he cult of glory and of the heroic military leader remained alive and well among Europeans in Africa and Asia, most especially among European soldiers.”[6] As previously mentioned, although Napoleon never prioritized creating or expanding a nationalist policy, his military prowess was later attributed to French culture; seeking to emulate the success of Napoleon, but in the context of non-authoritarian governments, such as in Great Britain, European countries intentionally employed nationalism to increase citizen support for imperialist policies. Although Napoleon did not possess the luxury of retrospectively analyzing the cultural influence his militarism yielded, post-Napoleonic European states did, and thus recognized that the form of nationalism Napoleon produced could be emulated and deployed to affect their respective citizens. One potent product of this revelation was world exhibitions. As Raymond Corbey explains in “Ethnographic Showcases, 1870-1930,” “nationalistic ambitions were apparent with the international character of the fairs;” after all, “[g]overnments were keenly aware of the opportunity to publicize their colonial policies and to manipulate public attitudes toward the newly acquired territories.”[7] Thus, by existing at the intersection of public leisure and government legislation, the artifacts and technologies exhibited here are inherently tied to the international “success” reaped by State conquest; consequently, citizen attendance serves as a direct commendation on the policies of the respective government. Overall, borrowing from the potency of Napoleonic memory and the former Emperor’s impact on the French population, European states utilized the idea of a common national culture to romanticize and garner acclaim for imperialism, while stifling public dissidence.
