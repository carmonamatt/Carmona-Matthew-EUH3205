Beyond influencing both international policy and militarism throughout the nineteenth-century, Napoleon advanced European thoughts of “national-selfhood.” Indeed, this is nowhere more apparent than in France during the post-Napoleonic era, particularly amidst the passage of restrictive international legislation by the Congress of Vienna. In fact, as Sudhir Hazareesingh states in his article “Memory, Legend and Politics: Napoleonic Patriotism in the Restoration Era,” the post-Napoleonic era was “a bedrock of ideas, beliefs, symbols and images which mythologized the Emperor and turned him into an object of popular cult;” Napoleon thus “became . . . a rallying point for all the men and women who refused to accept their nation’s containment by the 1815 treaties.”[^1] Thus, although conservative powers attempted to suppress the former French insurgence, this effort only heightened citizens’ incorporation of Napoleon into their public history as an element of cultural resistance. Arguably, the Restoration period encouraged a nostalgic, retrospective analysis of Napoleon’s reign on the part of French citizens. The Emperor himself persisted within the French state as an article of nationalist iconography; united by a shared experience, the French public venerated the legacy of Napoleon as a cultural, centripetal force.
        	Although this same nationalist-causational relationship cannot be superimposed on foreign territories conquered by Napoleon, the French Emperor nonetheless instilled notions of “political autonomy” and “nationhood” in said European peoples. In fact, this historical effect is entirely antithetical to the intentions of Napoleon’s regime, which did not envision a cultural indoctrination of new European subjects, as David A. Bell propounds. In his chapter “Revolutionary France and the Origins of Nationalism: An Old Problem Revisited,” Bell cites that “[o]ne became part of [France] by submitting to the Empire’s institutions and laws, and by giving complete and utter obedience to the Emperor.”[^2] And yet, although Napoleon’s imperial conquest did not champion cultural inclusivity so much as civil homogenization, his invasions inspired a reactionary nationalism from the principalities/states who attempted to thwart his political control. Indeed, the former French emperor served as a hearth for nationalism principally through the reactionary movements that his conquests inspired, rather than the very success of his imperial ventures. For example, as Filippo Sabetti contends, “[t]he Napoleonic hegemony over the Italian Peninsula between 1796 and 1814 helped to foster the idea that some kind of Italian nation existed or ought to exist.” Thus, as mentioned in Sabetti’s article, external influences, such as that of Napoleon, encouraged ideas of a public “collective,” one that sought to resist imperial demarcations. The geographic and political effects of Napoleon’s reign extended to the mid-century “springtime of peoples,” with “[t]he revolts of 1848 beg[inning] with the Palermo uprising against Bourbon rule in January 1848.”[^3] However, the presence of Napoleon’s influence in 1848 extended to other states as well, notably that of Germany. After all, Napoleon’s initial invasion of Germany in “[1806] brought humiliating military defeat and occupation for Prussia, the demise of the Holy Roman Empire, and a complete territorial and structural reorganization for the region,” as Katherine Aaelstad and Karen Hagemann conclude; the consequent result of such political turmoil—propagated by Napoleon—was a “German national ‘awakening’.”[^4] Thus, similar to Italy, the introduction of foreign control spurred questions of national as well as political selfhood. Furthermore, Napoleon’s empire cultivated a brief power vacancy in the German lands, removing older systems of power; by upending the former political order, Napoleon provided German citizens with the opportunity to generate new concepts of government, and more importantly, derive these concepts from cultural stimuli.
        	Building on the public nationalist fervor witnessed during “the springtime of peoples,” European imperialist efforts utilized cultural identities and histories to support their international expeditions, at the end of the nineteenth-century. In his 1885 History Repeats Itself, American Joseph Ferdinand Keppler embodies European fears of anti-imperialist sentiments. Depicting a figure akin to Julias Caesar in the far background and John Bull in the foreground, a destabilized Napoleon divides the two eras.[^5] Although Keppler’s work cautions European international ventures, it nonetheless demonstrates the pervasive influence Napoleon’s previous conquests within Europe had on late-nineteenth century imperialism. After all, as Bell elucidates, “[t]he cult of glory and of the heroic military leader remained alive and well among Europeans in Africa and Asia, most especially among European soldiers.”[^6] As previously mentioned, although Napoleon never prioritized creating or expanding a nationalist policy, his military prowess was later attributed to French culture; seeking to emulate the success of Napoleon, but in the context of non-authoritarian governments, such as in Great Britain, European countries intentionally employed nationalism to increase citizen support for imperialist policies. Although Napoleon did not possess the luxury of retrospectively analyzing the cultural influence his militarism yielded, post-Napoleonic European states did, and thus recognized that the form of nationalism Napoleon produced could be emulated and deployed to affect their respective citizens. One potent product of this revelation were world exhibitions. As Raymond Corbey explains in “Ethnographic Showcases, 1870-1930,” “nationalistic ambitions were apparent with the international character of the fairs;” after all, “[g]overnments were keenly aware of the opportunity to publicize their colonial policies and to manipulate public attitudes toward the newly acquired territories.”[^7] Thus, by existing at the intersection of public leisure and government legislation, the artifacts and technologies exhibited here are inherently tied to the international “success” reaped by State conquest; consequently, citizen attendance serves as a direct commendation on the policies of the respective government. Overall, borrowing from the potency of Napoleonic memory and the former Emperor’s impact on the French population, European states utilized the idea of a common national culture to romanticize and garner acclaim for imperialism, while stifling public dissidence.
