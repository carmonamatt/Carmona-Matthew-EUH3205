# Rise of Militarism 

Napoleon’s rule was characterized by intense military warfare. His triumphs led to a complete disruption of the former European order, forcing the rest of the continent to shift their perspective on the role of military within a nation. His influence is evident through the widespread adoption of conscription and the developing importance of artillery. The drastic reforms implemented are illustrated best by the rise of Prussian militarism which was introduced following their humiliating defeats during Napoleon's era. This section explores how Napoleon's military successes revolutionized the European approach to warfare, focusing on the adoption of conscription, the shift toward professional standing armies, and the transformation of Prussia's military system in the wake of Napoleon’s conquests.
Though the military draft had already been partially introduced during the French revolution, it was under Napoleon that “conscription became foundational to the country’s military system” and key within France’s culture.[^8] He introduced levée en masse which required all able-bodied men to assemble under his orders and ensured a well developed and expansive army to rival the European powers. This mass conscription was revolutionary in changing the dynamic of war and proved so by being implemented in other countries following his fall. (Must be expanded upon)
A unique aspect of Napoleon's military was the introduction of the corps system. Each of these structures had their own marshal, cavalry, infantry, and artillery effectively making each of them an independent, small army. This allowed for quick and decisive movements and “created semi-autonomous artillery formations which were under the command of smart, aggressive young artillery officers.”[^9] It is key to note that young officers were permitted to make these offensive artillery decisions because it was uncommon for this to happen without command from superiors. Being raised during and surrounded by the rhetoric of the French revolution, their spirits were fiery, independent, and determined, allowing them to make decisions with confidence. This mass movement towards war was made possible for Napoleon because of a rise in industrial efficiency and production[^10], allowing him to “offer his troops unprecedented artillery support.” (Must be expanded upon)
One of the most stark cases of Napoleon’s military influence is the transformation of Prussia’s military system following his conquests. Before Napoleon, Prussia was considered to be the major military power in Europe because their army was the highest priority of the state, but despite this “had been unable to resist Napoleon's blow.”[^11] Following their humiliating defeats, many of the Prussians—though filled with contempt for revolutionary ideals—admired Napoleon for his impressive strategies and his distinctly unique method of accomplishing victory. Lauterbach states that one of the Prussian generals, after 1805, believed that the army should be “the combination of all the moral and physical forces of a nation.” This shift from a professionalized army that focused primarily on enlisting noblemen to one of mass conscription including the peasantry made the concept of total warfare possible, completely altering the dynamic of war. This is a concept which Clausewitz (left off on pg. 17)

Beyond influencing both international policy and militarism throughout the nineteenth-century, Napoleon advanced European thoughts of “national-selfhood.” Indeed, this is nowhere more apparent than in France during the post-Napoleonic era, particularly amidst the passage of restrictive international legislation by the Congress of Vienna. In fact, as Sudhir Hazareesingh states in his article “Memory, Legend and Politics: Napoleonic Patriotism in the Restoration Era,” the post-Napoleonic era was “a bedrock of ideas, beliefs, symbols and images which mythologized the Emperor and turned him into an object of popular cult;” Napoleon thus “became . . . a rallying point for all the men and women who refused to accept their nation’s containment by the 1815 treaties.”[^1] Thus, although conservative powers attempted to suppress the former French insurgence, this effort only heightened citizens’ incorporation of Napoleon into their public history as an element of cultural resistance. Arguably, the Restoration period encouraged a nostalgic, retrospective analysis of Napoleon’s reign on the part of French citizens. The Emperor himself persisted within the French state as an article of nationalist iconography; united by a shared experience, the French public venerated the legacy of Napoleon as a cultural, centripetal force.
        	Although this same nationalist-causational relationship cannot be superimposed on foreign territories conquered by Napoleon, the French Emperor nonetheless instilled notions of “political autonomy” and “nationhood” in said European peoples. In fact, this historical effect is entirely antithetical to the intentions of Napoleon’s regime, which did not envision a cultural indoctrination of new European subjects, as David A. Bell propounds. In his chapter “Revolutionary France and the Origins of Nationalism: An Old Problem Revisited,” Bell cites that “[o]ne became part of [France] by submitting to the Empire’s institutions and laws, and by giving complete and utter obedience to the Emperor.”[^2] And yet, although Napoleon’s imperial conquest did not champion cultural inclusivity so much as civil homogenization, his invasions inspired a reactionary nationalism from the principalities/states who attempted to thwart his political control. Indeed, the former French emperor served as a hearth for nationalism principally through the reactionary movements that his conquests inspired, rather than the very success of his imperial ventures. For example, as Filippo Sabetti contends, “[t]he Napoleonic hegemony over the Italian Peninsula between 1796 and 1814 helped to foster the idea that some kind of Italian nation existed or ought to exist.” Thus, as mentioned in Sabetti’s article, external influences, such as that of Napoleon, encouraged ideas of a public “collective,” one that sought to resist imperial demarcations. The geographic and political effects of Napoleon’s reign extended to the mid-century “springtime of peoples,” with “[t]he revolts of 1848 beg[inning] with the Palermo uprising against Bourbon rule in January 1848.”[^3] However, the presence of Napoleon’s influence in 1848 extended to other states as well, notably that of Germany. After all, Napoleon’s initial invasion of Germany in “[1806] brought humiliating military defeat and occupation for Prussia, the demise of the Holy Roman Empire, and a complete territorial and structural reorganization for the region,” as Katherine Aaelstad and Karen Hagemann conclude; the consequent result of such political turmoil—propagated by Napoleon—was a “German national ‘awakening’.”[^4] Thus, similar to Italy, the introduction of foreign control spurred questions of national as well as political selfhood. Furthermore, Napoleon’s empire cultivated a brief power vacancy in the German lands, removing older systems of power; by upending the former political order, Napoleon provided German citizens with the opportunity to generate new concepts of government, and more importantly, derive these concepts from cultural stimuli.
        	Building on the public nationalist fervor witnessed during “the springtime of peoples,” European imperialist efforts utilized cultural identities and histories to support their international expeditions, at the end of the nineteenth-century. In his 1885 History Repeats Itself, American Joseph Ferdinand Keppler embodies European fears of anti-imperialist sentiments. Depicting a figure akin to Julias Caesar in the far background and John Bull in the foreground, a destabilized Napoleon divides the two eras.[^5] Although Keppler’s work cautions European international ventures, it nonetheless demonstrates the pervasive influence Napoleon’s previous conquests within Europe had on late-nineteenth century imperialism. After all, as Bell elucidates, “[t]he cult of glory and of the heroic military leader remained alive and well among Europeans in Africa and Asia, most especially among European soldiers.”[^6] As previously mentioned, although Napoleon never prioritized creating or expanding a nationalist policy, his military prowess was later attributed to French culture; seeking to emulate the success of Napoleon, but in the context of non-authoritarian governments, such as in Great Britain, European countries intentionally employed nationalism to increase citizen support for imperialist policies. Although Napoleon did not possess the luxury of retrospectively analyzing the cultural influence his militarism yielded, post-Napoleonic European states did, and thus recognized that the form of nationalism Napoleon produced could be emulated and deployed to affect their respective citizens. One potent product of this revelation were world exhibitions. As Raymond Corbey explains in “Ethnographic Showcases, 1870-1930,” “nationalistic ambitions were apparent with the international character of the fairs;” after all, “[g]overnments were keenly aware of the opportunity to publicize their colonial policies and to manipulate public attitudes toward the newly acquired territories.”[^7] Thus, by existing at the intersection of public leisure and government legislation, the artifacts and technologies exhibited here are inherently tied to the international “success” reaped by State conquest; consequently, citizen attendance serves as a direct commendation on the policies of the respective government. Overall, borrowing from the potency of Napoleonic memory and the former Emperor’s impact on the French population, European states utilized the idea of a common national culture to romanticize and garner acclaim for imperialism, while stifling public dissidence.
