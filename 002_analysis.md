# Social Issues and Policies

When Napoleon was first able to seize power, France was in a period of political and economic instability.  The current government in power, The Directory, was widely unpopular, the French Revolution had upended traditional social order and created chaos.  The Directory, a committee of five corrupt officials that was formed in 1795 after the fall of Robespierre was unfavorable to the people.  In addition, the French Government was also bankrupt, with high inflation, unemployment rates, and taxation.  These major political and social turmoils put Napoleon in the strategic position to seize power. (History Today).  Using his stellar military reputation and the people’s hatred of the Directory to gain power, Napoleon staged a coup d’etat in 1799 which resulted in replacing the Directory with a three-person Consulate leadership. Napoleon placed himself in charge of the new government as First Consul (Britannica).  On May 18th, 1804, using the censorship of the press and presenting himself as the leader France needs, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French and thus abolished the Consulate. 

The period before Napoleon’s rise to power was riddled with social, economic, and political issues that all played a factor in Napoleon’s rise to power and his policies.  First, before and during Napoleon's reign France was divided into three distinct social groups entitled the Three Estates.  The First Estate consisted of the clergy who were largely exempt from taxes.  The Second Estate included the aristocracy who also enjoyed significant privileges and tax exemptions.  The Third Estate included the vast majority of the population such as peasants, artisans, the working class, commoners, and the bourgeoisie.  Despite having very little political power, this Third Estate was responsible for most of the taxes.  This political and economic inequality created dissatisfaction and tension between the classes.  When Napoleon rose to power, the Estates system remained largely unchanged, nevertheless Napoleon was widely popular among the military, the bourgeoisie and the workers.  Napoleon had a few followers among the First and Second estates, but the Third Estate supported him for his promise of a new social order, economic stability, nationalism, military success, and the formation of a meritocracy (ThoughtCo).  The diverse social order of the Three Estates was not the only social issue during Napoleon’s rise to power.  Under the Directory in 1797, the French Empire went bankrupt.  Inflation also skyrocketed when the anti-French coalition printed and circulated 4-billion counterfeit bills.  In turn, this led to a food crisis and unemployment.  The financial crisis helped Napoleon gain and maintain power through his promises to restore economic stability.  The financial crisis also had a large impact on Napoleon’s financial policies.  Also, before Napoleon’s rise to power women had little autonomy and society was largely patriarchal.  Fathers and husbands were given power over their families, property, wives, and children.  Women’s rights were very limited, and they were considered legally subordinate to their husbands.  Divorce was also more restrictive for women, and until 1965, women were not allowed to work without their husband’s permission (Hurt’s Page the Napoleonic Code).  Napoleon’s code and policies did not impact or change women’s social situation which demonstrates some of Napoleon’s conservative and traditional tendencies.  His policies show he believes that women should be subordinate to men.  Lasty, before Napoleon’s rise to power, there was already limited political freedom for the commons and the Third Estate.  Despite the Third Estate’s hopes, this did not change much under Napoleon.  Instead, Napoleon increased censorship of the press and limited opposition through plebiscites, press, and political control.  In 1802, Napoleon held a plebiscite to elect himself Consul for Life.  In 1804, Napoleon held another plebiscite, this time to crown himself emperor.  By plebiscites and censorship of the press, Napoleon kept tight political control and did not increase political rights much for the Third Estate (Napoleon.Org).  Now that we have covered some of the major social, economic, and political issues before and during Napoleon’s rise to power, we can discuss Napoleon’s policies and how they affected the French political and social climate. 
            
One of Napoleon’s biggest policies was the Napoleonic Code designed to unify and update outdated laws of the French Empire and make the laws better known to the common people.  Known as the French Civil Code, the Napoleonic Code was a uniform set of laws implemented in 1804.  The Civil Code codified several different branches of law and created categories for criminal, civil, and family law.  The code did not alter the Estate system or give the Third Estate more political power like they had hoped, but it did allow for the laws to be published instead of being arbitrarily decided.  While the code did not alter the Estate system, all male citizens were granted equal rights and the right to religious freedom.  The French Civil Code also did not improve the social standing of women.  Instead, the code made husbands have ultimate authority over their wives, and deprived women of rights (Napoleonic Code).  Despite maintain some of the traditional social order, the Napoleonic code with widely popular because it abolished feudalism, protected property rights which benefited the bourgeoisie, it created equality before the law, it simplified and made the legal system known and re-introduced colonial slavery and stronger economic policies (Britannica).  Another one of Napoleon’s policies that was driven by the economic crisis before his rise to power was the creation of the Bank of France.  In 1800, Napoleon created the Bank of France to stabilize the financial crisis.  The banking spread across France, and it sought to correct inflation by backing paper money with gold.  The bank was funded by shareholders and the state gained increasing control over the bank.  The banking system also created a monopoly on banknotes and helped fund the treasury (Banque de France).  Napoleon’s Bank of France played a huge role in decreasing inflation, helping increase unemployment, centralizing the banking, improving paper money, tax collection, industry and commerce.  Napoleon created the Bank of France to help dissipate the financial crisis and promote French business, and he did successfully do just that (European EU).  Napoleon’s last major policy was the implementation of colonial slavery.  In 1802, Napoleon decided to reimplement colonial slavery to help improve France’s financial situation.  Previously, slavery was abolished in 1794, but the demand for sugar and the financial opportunities of trade caused Napoleon to reinstitute slavery in Saint-Domingue, French Guiana and Guadeloupe.  However, this policy was largely unpopular and led to a massive uprising in Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti).  All in all, the economic policy of re-implementing slavery was one of Napoleon's mistakes, but it still shows the political and economic climate under Napoleon that motivated his policies. Napoleon's major policies were heavily influenced by the social, political, and economic climate both before and during his rise to power in 19th Century France.


# Rise of Militarism

Napoleon’s rule was characterized by intense military warfare. His triumphs led to a complete disruption of the former European order, forcing the rest of the continent to shift their perspective on the role of military within a nation. His influence is evident through the widespread adoption of conscription and the developing importance of artillery. The drastic reforms implemented are illustrated best by the rise of Prussian militarism which was introduced following their humiliating defeats during Napoleon's era. This section explores how Napoleon's military successes revolutionized the European approach to warfare, focusing on the adoption of conscription, the shift toward professional standing armies, and the transformation of Prussia's military system in the wake of Napoleon’s conquests.
                
Though the military draft had already been partially introduced during the French revolution, it was under Napoleon that “conscription became foundational to the country’s military system” and key within France’s culture.[^8] He introduced levée en masse which required all able-bodied men to assemble under his orders and ensured a well developed and expansive army to rival the European powers. This mass conscription was revolutionary in changing the dynamic of war and proved so by being implemented in other countries following his fall. (Must be expanded upon

A unique aspect of Napoleon's military was the introduction of the corps system. Each of these structures had their own marshal, cavalry, infantry, and artillery effectively making each of them an independent, small army. This allowed for quick and decisive movements and “created semi-autonomous artillery formations which were under the command of smart, aggressive young artillery officers.”[^9] It is key to note that young officers were permitted to make these offensive artillery decisions because it was uncommon for this to happen without command from superiors. Being raised during and surrounded by the rhetoric of the French revolution, their spirits were fiery, independent, and determined, allowing them to make decisions with confidence. This mass movement towards war was made possible for Napoleon because of a rise in industrial efficiency and production[^10], allowing him to “offer his troops unprecedented artillery support.” (Must be expanded upon)

One of the most stark cases of Napoleon’s military influence is the transformation of Prussia’s military system following his conquests. Before Napoleon, Prussia was considered to be the major military power in Europe because their army was the highest priority of the state, but despite this “had been unable to resist Napoleon's blow.”[^11] Following their humiliating defeats, many of the Prussians—though filled with contempt for revolutionary ideals—admired Napoleon for his impressive strategies and his distinctly unique method of accomplishing victory. Lauterbach states that one of the Prussian generals, after 1805, believed that the army should be “the combination of all the moral and physical forces of a nation.” This shift from a professionalized army that focused primarily on enlisting noblemen to one of mass conscription including the peasantry made the concept of total warfare possible, completely altering the dynamic of war. This is a concept which Clausewitz (left off on pg. 17)


# Nationalism

Beyond influencing both international policy and militarism throughout the nineteenth-century, Napoleon advanced European thoughts of “national-selfhood.” Indeed, this is nowhere more apparent than in France during the post-Napoleonic era, particularly amidst the passage of restrictive international legislation by the Congress of Vienna. In fact, as Sudhir Hazareesingh states in his article “Memory, Legend and Politics: Napoleonic Patriotism in the Restoration Era,” the post-Napoleonic era was “a bedrock of ideas, beliefs, symbols and images which mythologized the Emperor and turned him into an object of popular cult;” Napoleon thus “became . . . a rallying point for all the men and women who refused to accept their nation’s containment by the 1815 treaties.”[^1] Thus, although conservative powers attempted to suppress the former French insurgence, this effort only heightened citizens’ incorporation of Napoleon into their public history as an element of cultural resistance. Arguably, the Restoration period encouraged a nostalgic, retrospective analysis of Napoleon’s reign on the part of French citizens. The Emperor himself persisted within the French state as an article of nationalist iconography; united by a shared experience, the French public venerated the legacy of Napoleon as a cultural, centripetal force.

Although this same nationalist-causational relationship cannot be superimposed on foreign territories conquered by Napoleon, the French Emperor nonetheless instilled notions of “political autonomy” and “nationhood” in said European peoples. In fact, this historical effect is entirely antithetical to the intentions of Napoleon’s regime, which did not envision a cultural indoctrination of new European subjects, as David A. Bell propounds. In his chapter “Revolutionary France and the Origins of Nationalism: An Old Problem Revisited,” Bell cites that “[o]ne became part of [France] by submitting to the Empire’s institutions and laws, and by giving complete and utter obedience to the Emperor.”[^2] And yet, although Napoleon’s imperial conquest did not champion cultural inclusivity so much as civil homogenization, his invasions inspired a reactionary nationalism from the principalities/states who attempted to thwart his political control. Indeed, the former French emperor served as a hearth for nationalism principally through the reactionary movements that his conquests inspired, rather than the very success of his imperial ventures. For example, as Filippo Sabetti contends, “[t]he Napoleonic hegemony over the Italian Peninsula between 1796 and 1814 helped to foster the idea that some kind of Italian nation existed or ought to exist.” Thus, as mentioned in Sabetti’s article, external influences, such as that of Napoleon, encouraged ideas of a public “collective,” one that sought to resist imperial demarcations. The geographic and political effects of Napoleon’s reign extended to the mid-century “springtime of peoples,” with “[t]he revolts of 1848 beg[inning] with the Palermo uprising against Bourbon rule in January 1848.”[^3] However, the presence of Napoleon’s influence in 1848 extended to other states as well, notably that of Germany. After all, Napoleon’s initial invasion of Germany in “[1806] brought humiliating military defeat and occupation for Prussia, the demise of the Holy Roman Empire, and a complete territorial and structural reorganization for the region,” as Katherine Aaelstad and Karen Hagemann conclude; the consequent result of such political turmoil—propagated by Napoleon—was a “German national ‘awakening’.”[^4] Thus, similar to Italy, the introduction of foreign control spurred questions of national as well as political selfhood. Furthermore, Napoleon’s empire cultivated a brief power vacancy in the German lands, removing older systems of power; by upending the former political order, Napoleon provided German citizens with the opportunity to generate new concepts of government, and more importantly, derive these concepts from cultural stimuli.
         
Building on the public nationalist fervor witnessed during “the springtime of peoples,” European imperialist efforts utilized cultural identities and histories to support their international expeditions, at the end of the nineteenth-century. In his 1885 History Repeats Itself, American Joseph Ferdinand Keppler embodies European fears of anti-imperialist sentiments. Depicting a figure akin to Julias Caesar in the far background and John Bull in the foreground, a destabilized Napoleon divides the two eras.[^5] Although Keppler’s work cautions European international ventures, it nonetheless demonstrates the pervasive influence Napoleon’s previous conquests within Europe had on late-nineteenth century imperialism. After all, as Bell elucidates, “[t]he cult of glory and of the heroic military leader remained alive and well among Europeans in Africa and Asia, most especially among European soldiers.”[^6] As previously mentioned, although Napoleon never prioritized creating or expanding a nationalist policy, his military prowess was later attributed to French culture; seeking to emulate the success of Napoleon, but in the context of non-authoritarian governments, such as in Great Britain, European countries intentionally employed nationalism to increase citizen support for imperialist policies. Although Napoleon did not possess the luxury of retrospectively analyzing the cultural influence his militarism yielded, post-Napoleonic European states did, and thus recognized that the form of nationalism Napoleon produced could be emulated and deployed to affect their respective citizens. One potent product of this revelation were world exhibitions. As Raymond Corbey explains in “Ethnographic Showcases, 1870-1930,” “nationalistic ambitions were apparent with the international character of the fairs;” after all, “[g]overnments were keenly aware of the opportunity to publicize their colonial policies and to manipulate public attitudes toward the newly acquired territories.”[^7] Thus, by existing at the intersection of public leisure and government legislation, the artifacts and technologies exhibited here are inherently tied to the international “success” reaped by State conquest; consequently, citizen attendance serves as a direct commendation on the policies of the respective government. Overall, borrowing from the potency of Napoleonic memory and the former Emperor’s impact on the French population, European states utilized the idea of a common national culture to romanticize and garner acclaim for imperialism, while stifling public dissidence.
